      Graduated with honors in Philosophy and Computer Science

I am a doctoral student in Philosophy at the University of Rochester, specializing in the intersection of ethics, political theory, and artificial intelligence. My research explores how AI systems interact with foundational concepts in virtue ethics, liberal justice, and epistemology, with a focus on questions of character, autonomy, and moral development.

Bridging philosophy and engineering, I work at the intersection of technical governance and alignment research—examining how algorithmic architectures and institutional norms co-determine the moral trajectories of AI systems. My projects include VirtueProbes, a framework for identifying latent moral representations within language models, and OpenAudit, an open-source platform for reproducible black-box auditing and fairness research.

I am especially interested in how Rawlsian political liberalism can accommodate empirical truths about human cognition and vulnerability, guiding the design of socio-technical institutions without imposing comprehensive doctrines. My broader work integrates Bayesian epistemology, neurosymbolic learning, and virtue-based ethics to study how AI systems—and the societies deploying them—can learn to act responsibly.

Previously, I founded and led SALVé, an AI development company that built automation and conversational systems for businesses. I also write for Filosof.IA, a Spanish-language blog reflecting on the philosophy of technology. My long-term goal is to help build the conceptual and technical foundations for an ethically responsible AI ecosystem—one that aligns machine capability with human flourishing.
