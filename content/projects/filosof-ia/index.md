Filosof.IA is a Spanish-written blog and podcast where I document my learnings and unedited thoughts on Philosophy of AI and, more broadly, Philosophy of Technology.

The platform serves as a space for philosophical reflection in Spanish on emerging technologies, making philosophical discourse about AI accessible to Spanish-speaking audiences. Topics range from technical AI ethics to broader questions about how technology shapes society, politics, and human experience.

This project reflects my commitment to building bridges between philosophical communities and making critical reflection on technology available beyond anglophone academic circles.
