Deep Lore LATAM is an academic community I founded to advance critical and strategic reflection on the impact of artificial intelligence on freedom, culture, and politics in Latin America.

The initiative brings together researchers, philosophers, and practitioners to examine how AI technologies interact with Latin American social, political, and cultural contexts. We explore questions of technological sovereignty, ethical AI development, and the implications of AI systems for democratic governance and cultural identity in the region.
