OpenAudit is an open-source platform designed to facilitate reproducible black-box auditing of AI systems and support fairness research. The platform provides tools and methodologies for researchers and practitioners to systematically evaluate AI systems for bias, fairness, and ethical concerns.

This project aims to democratize AI auditing capabilities and promote transparency in AI governance by making sophisticated auditing tools accessible to the broader research community.
